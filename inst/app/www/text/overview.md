Risk analysis and management entails both qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative methods used in Risk Analysis strongly rely on sound statistical methods and Montecarlo simulation. Performing and reporting quantitative risk has become crucial in Cybersecurity, which affects all sectors, including finance. Actually, Cybersecurity risks are included within the “operational risks” in the finance sector. 

Regarding information security, the FAIR methodology developed by the Open Group has become a standard for cybersecurity risk analysis. FAIR uses PERT distributions to simulate impact (loss) based on experts input. However, other distributions and methods can be used for analysing risks, e.g., lognormal distributions based in probability intervals, among others.

This is a shiny app for simulating cybersecurity losses, based on the FAIR method, but with important improvements.

**Instructions:**

1. Select the probability distributions you are using to model loss event frequency and loss magnitude.
2. Change the number of simulations according to your preferences.
3. Set a seed if you want the results be reproducible.
4. Change the units of loss if needed (only for visualization purposes)
5. Go to the **Parameters** page. Input the values for the chosen probability distributions.
6. Run the simulations.
7. Go to the results page to visualize the results.
