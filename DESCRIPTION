Description: a shiny app for simulating cybersecurity losses,
  allowing the user to choose whether to use the FAIR methodology,
  or modifications to it, such as different probability distributions,
  or modifications on the FAIR ontology. Statistical analysis of the simulation
  results are shown by means of interactive tables and plots.
  From the own app, a report can be generated automatically and downloaded for further use.
  The report is generated in html, docx or pdf by means of a quarto document template.
  The app is also useful for teaching Risk Analysis in Degree courses on cybersecurity.
